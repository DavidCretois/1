Site de David CRETOIS

Hi everyone, my name is David, I'm deaf and I dream of developing a lot of things and I'm interested in innovation and space transportation and also in electronics.
Primarily, I focus on programming and logic, algorithms and also today I'm just learning artificial intelligence.
Finally, I would like to thank GitHub for deploying my site to explain my projects and my life as well.
Good luck.
